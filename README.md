## Brief Description
This project is a generative AI chat application about all information related 
to champions, regions, alternate universe, etc. in League of Legends using 
RAG-LangChain pipelines.

## Architecture
This project uses the OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini as the large language model (LLM) 
for the LangChain's conversational retrieval chain and Gradio as the chat 
interface for the project.

universe, etc. from League of Legends (the whole contents are copied exactly).
