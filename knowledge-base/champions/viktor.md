# Viktor

## Summary
The fully biomechanical evolution of his former self, Viktor has embraced his 
Glorious Evolution and become something of a messiah to his followers. He 
sacrificed his own humanity under the logic that eliminating emotion would 
thereby eliminate sufferingâ€”and now seeks to bring the revelation of the hexcore 
to the rest of the world, even if they're incapable of understanding the benefit. 
After all, to this master of the arcane, violence is merely a variable necessary 
to balance the ultimate equation.
