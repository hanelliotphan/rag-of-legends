# Mel

## Summary
Mel Medarda is the presumed heir of the Medarda family, once one of the most 
powerful in Noxus. In appearance she is a graceful aristocrat, but beneath the 
surface lies a skilled politician who makes it her business to know everything 
about everyone she meets. After an encounter with the mysterious Black Rose, 
Mel discovered the depths of her mother's deception and, for once, faced a 
situation potentially beyond her control. With newly awakened magical abilities, 
she sailed home in search of answersâ€”and though many still seek to temper the 
light within her, Mel's soul remains forever defiant.
