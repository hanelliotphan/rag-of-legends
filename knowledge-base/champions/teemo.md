## Summary
Teemo is the fearless leader of the Bandle Scouts—a group of intrepid yordles 
dedicated to exploring Runeterra and learning about the great big world. He 
ventures far and wide, completing challenges to earn merit badges, writing new 
rules to add to the ever-growing Bandle Scout Handbook, and leaving exploding

## Biography
On my honor as a scout, I will strive:
To help every living thing thrive
To be a friend to all in need
To seek out every rock and tree
To be honest and kind and brave and true
To try my best in all I do
To meet every challenge with courage and wit
And to leave the world better than when I found it
So I pledge to uphold the Bandle Scout way
And serve yordlekind each and every day!

—The Bandle Scout Oath

Teemo has been a Bandle Scout for as long as he can remember—hopping through 
portals all across Runeterra in order to find people in need (badge 131: “Help 
a Stranger”), to befriend new creatures (badge 389: “Adopt a Pet”), or even to 
document strange new species of mushrooms (badge 248: “Fungology Expert”). For 
Teemo, there was no greater joy than spending his days seeking adventure and 
earning Bandle Scout badges, which was how he became the most decorated Bandle 
Scout the world had ever seen.

Bandle Scout rule #154: Never fear the unknown.

When other yordles saw everything Teemo had accomplished, his dedication and 
enthusiasm inspired them to become Bandle Scouts. What began as a single scout 
with a dream grew and grew until Teemo was handing out badges to intrepid young 
cadets and writing new copies of the Bandle Scout rules for their journeys 
across Runeterra (rules he’d luckily memorized, since his original handbook was 
lost somewhere in the waters south of the Serpent Isles while he was learning 
to tie sailing knots).

Bandle Scout rule #13: Every day is an adventure. Make sure you are prepared!

When one cadet surveyed yordles across Runeterra regarding Bandle Scout 
contributions (badge 567: “Market Research”), the feedback was unanimous—under 
Teemo’s fearless leadership, the Bandle Scouts were beloved the world over:

“Teemo is SO COOL. One time, I saw him stop a raging stampede of wild horses. 
It was awesome!”
—Ava, Bandle Scout

“The Bandle Scouts have grown a lot. They put on this great big festival a 
while ago—had floats and everything. It was pretty neat. They even let me set 
off some fireworks!”
—Tristana, the Bandle Gunner

“I love those rascals with their missions and badges and adventurer’s moxy. It 
brings a happy tear to this old pilot’s eye.”
—Corki, the Daring Bombardier

“What the @#$%*^ is a Bandle Scout?”
—Kled, High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double 
Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company

Teemo even introduced the world to Bandle Scout biscuits, now carried by scouts 
all across Runeterra. Their inventory includes over a hundred exciting and 
unique flavors, such as:

- Poro-Snax
- Old Cheese
- Honeyfruit
- Meat!
- Limited Edition Spirit Blossom
- Bilge Rat
- Helian Puff-Pastry (permanently retired)
- Shuriman Sand
- And many more!

Nowadays, Teemo is focusing on completing Bandle Scout missions of his own 
design. His most recent achievements are propagating a near-extinct species of 
exploding mushroom, and freeing all the cute little basilisks in a Noxian war 
camp (who looked so very sad inside their stables). He’s also researching the 
origins of the Bandle Scouts—who founded it? Made the first badge? Penned the 
first rule? And could it have been Teemo himself in a time long lost to his 
memories? Eh, he can’t remember! But no matter the mission, one thing remains 
constant, which is Teemo’s dedication to live by the words of the Scout’s Oath: 
to uphold the Bandle Scout way, and serve yordlekind each and every day.
