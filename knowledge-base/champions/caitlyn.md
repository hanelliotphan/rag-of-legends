# Caitlyn

## Summary
Renowned as its finest peacekeeper, Caitlyn Kiramman is also Piltover's best 
shot at ridding the city of its elusive criminal elements. She is often paired
with Vi, acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner's more impetuous nature. 
Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn's most powerful 
weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any 
lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.
