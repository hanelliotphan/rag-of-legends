# Vi

## Summary
Raised on the mean streets of Zaun, Vi is a hotheaded, impulsive, and fearsome 
woman with very little respect for authority. She has always been a shrewd 
survivor, both from her youthful troublemaking topside and an unfairly long 
stint in Stillwater Hold. Now working with the Piltover Enforcers to keep the 
peace instead of breaking it, she wields mighty hextech gauntlets that can 
punch through walls—and criminals—with equal ease.
