# Jayce

## Summary
Jayce Talis is a brilliant inventor who, along with his friend Viktor, made the 
first great discoveries in the field of hextech. Celebrated across Piltover, he 
tries to live up to his reputation as "the Man of Progress," but often 
struggles with the expectations placed upon him. Because of this, Jayce has 
begun to see the ways in which his invention has furthered the division between 
Piltover and Zaunâ€”and armed with his hextech hammer, he stands ready to defend 
tomorrow.
