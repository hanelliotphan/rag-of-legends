## About
A member of Ahri’s original team, Miss Fortune is a hot-headed gunslinger, 
renowned across the galaxy as a monster slayer. Angry at losing comrades, the 
second-in-command now fights in their memory—not out of a sense of duty, but 
for vengeance. Even with new members joining the team, she can’t forget her 
past. She is always the first to charge into battle, often ignoring her own 
safety as long as she can take down every beast in sight. Her short temper 
often leads to butting heads with teammates who she sees as wasting time when 
they could be laying waste to the enemy. Despite being scornful of others, the 
only member of the team Miss Fortune truly holds at a distance is Syndra, who 
she suspects has less noble reasons for her return.

## Magical Mediums
Boki & Baki - Boki and Baki are twins born of Sarah Fortune’s desire for 
vengeance, but it’s hard to tell by their playful, best-friends-forever 
demeanor. Where Miss Fortune charges forward with a burning rage, this duo 
allies with her from a more easygoing perspective. It’s no fun watching the bad 
guys burn if you can’t butt-bump about it!
