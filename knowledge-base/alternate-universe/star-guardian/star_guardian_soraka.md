## About
A gentle soul with a mysterious origin among the stars, Soraka protects the 
team on their perilous missions from behind the frontlines. Despite her fragile 
appearance, the second-year carries immense healing power, unparalleled by any 
other Guardian the team has encountered. Her unprecedented command of the 
Starlight and willingness to put everyone else’s needs ahead of hers has earned 
the team’s trust and respect—the ever-humble warrior, Soraka only shyly accepts 
her responsibility. Like Lulu, she has a special connection to the stars, 
though she and her team do not fully understand it yet.

## Magical Mediums
Shisa - Grumpy and overprotective, Shisa guards Soraka from anything that could 
threaten her safety, including her own naiveté. The tenacious creature is often 
frustrated by Soraka’s trusting nature, and will throw itself into a fit or 
sulk for a good while afterwards–although red bean ice cream has been known to 
cut its tantrum time down by half.
