## About
Ahri is a charismatic captain who leads a team of both new and veteran Star 
Guardians, from the outer edges of the cosmos. Having experienced the pain of 
losing teammates in the line of duty, she is viciously protective of her 
“family,” and a strong desire burns within her to ensure no one she cares for 
ever fades away again. These events have also shaped how she approaches other 
teams and their captains, especially the less experienced ones like Lux. 
There’s no more room for patience and understanding in her universe—tough love 
is all that’s left. Though that be the case, none are immune to Ahri’s own 
unique charms.

## Magical Mediums
Kiko - The mischievous Kiko accompanies Ahri as a vulpine embodiment of her 
charisma… and sass. Even unprompted, Kiko isn’t shy about saying how it really 
feels, though only Ahri can understand its unique language. As biting as the 
creature’s manners can sometimes be, it’s not too proud to turn down a good 
belly rub and cuddle. Just try to refrain from saying, “Aww.”
