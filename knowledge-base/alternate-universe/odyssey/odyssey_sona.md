## Biography
One of the mysterious Templars, Sona has a curious affinity with ora—the 
divine, golden lifeblood of all civilization. She was the most gifted child 
born to her order in a generation, with the rare ability to commune directly 
with the ora-producing megafauna that drift peacefully through the cold depths 
of space. Warned by them in strange, apocalyptic visions, Sona traveled with 
two other Templars and their followers to the edgeworld of Ionan. An ageless 
creature not of this universe waited there for the day it could free itself, 
and begin its dark work…

Unfortunately, they were pursued by slingtroopers from the Demaxian Empire, 
and Sona only survived the ensuing firefight by hiding among her disheveled 
militia fighters as they were taken prisoner. Ordinal Shieda Kayn, clearly 
under the influence of the insidious creature Rhaast, ordered them to be taken 
to the Locus Armada for questioning. Sona was able to escape his clutches, but 
at great cost—the man who helped her escape, Yone, was murdered by Kayn himself.

With nowhere else to turn, she sought out Yone’s troubled younger brother 
Yasuo, and joined his ragtag crew aboard the Morning Star, hoping to avert the 
as-yet unknown disaster that will apparently destroy all of creation.

After watching Jinx’s recruitment video, she’s still at least, like, 85% sure 
that saving the universe is actually the right decision.

## Weapon
The Ora

Sona is able to commune with ora and, in so doing, use it as a weapon, shield, 
and personal confidant. It tells her secrets (probably), gossips about all the 
latest Templar drama (possibly), and sometimes the two of them cut giant robots 
in half with liquid, golden energy.

More importantly, Sona does not utilize ora the same way most sentient beings 
do. She doesn’t have to implant herselt with augments or undergo expensive body 
modifications with potentially hazardous technology—she just asks her little, 
shiny ball for favors, and it performs them. It’s a miracle of modern… well, 
not science. Something like science, but better.
