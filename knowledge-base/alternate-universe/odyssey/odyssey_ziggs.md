## Biography
A disgraced engineer previously known for revolutionary advances in ora mining, 
Ziggs lost everything when a young recruit and her hulking manager 
“accidentally” rigged one of his devices to explode, vaporizing half—

Look, you weren’t there, okay? Enough with the attitude. Just let me tell you 
all about Ziggs for a second. It won’t take long, he’s pretty short.

He made a fortune in his younger years, as one of the foremost experts on ora 
extraction, refinement, and weapon modding—so much that it all immediately went 
to his head, as fame tends to do. Developing even more efficient methods of 
extraction as he bounced between contracts, Ziggs was on the cusp of a major 
breakthrough before his world came tumbling down.

Or rather, his moon did.

Basically, the planetoid he was working on exploded in a fiery blast that 
vaporized hundreds of trillions of credits worth of crystallized ora. The 
diminutive engineer was instantly blamed, his credits and assets were seized, 
and he vanished in a barely-spaceworthy mining vessel with nothing but the 
bombs on his back and a chip on his shoulder. He hasn’t been seen in any 
respectable planetary system since.

Bitter and manic, he now slings between ora hotspots out on the galactic edge, 
in a mad gamble to regain his former prestige… hoping against hope that he 
never, ever, under any circumstances, encounters the recruit and her manager 
again. Heh.

## Weapon
Patented Explosive Compounds

Harnessing the sometimes highly volatile nature of ora, Zigg’s uniquely blended 
explosives deliver a massively destructive but focused payload to any target, 
making them perfect for mining operations. The advancement was a corporate 
miracle at the time, but copycat Syndicate weaponeers soon emerged with 
cheaper, less dangerous alternatives that Ziggs didn’t approve of. Never one to 
be outdone by a rival, he’s jury-rigged even more unstable modifications to the 
original devices in the hopes that he’ll “show them all, hee hee hee…” [sic]

Dozens of viscous, highly toxic chemical compounds harvested from creatures and 
locales across the galaxy swirl dangerously inside any Ziggs-developed 
explosive, and even the slightest tap could set the whole cluster off at once. 
He seems basically fine with this, and the gigantic demolition charge strapped 
to his back also serves as a warning to any roving space pirates trying to 
muscle in on his action.

You blow up Ziggs, Ziggs blows up you. Fair trade.
