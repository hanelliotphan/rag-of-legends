## Biography
Adept at building and/or destroying (but mostly destroying) an array of 
haphazard, highly unstable weapons for the Morning Star crew, Jinx pilots the 
ship into an endless barrage of extremely dangerous misadventures. It is 
unclear why Yasuo hired her, beyond rumors of a 48-hour long bender in the 
formerly un-destroyed spinward quadrant of the Ludum Nebula. The two have been 
staunch allies ever since.

Consistently excitable and deeply unstable, Jinx counts among her former 
employers a series of asteroid miners and military gear manufacturers, most of 
whom present severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder whenever her 
name is mentioned. She enjoys crash landing on hostile worlds for fun, 
“accidentally” obliterating moons with the Morning Star’s main cannon, and 
definitely not being obsessed with Ordinal Kayn, a man who is actively 
attempting to kill the whole crew.

She considers Malphite her best friend in the universe… mostly because she got 
him fired, but also because he can punch things really, really hard.

## Weapon
Jinx's Arsenal

Jinx carries enough weapons at any given time to lay siege to a small-to-medium 
Demaxian battle fortress. Of note are Fishbones, a rocket launcher who seems 
genuinely concerned for its owner’s wellbeing; Pow-Pow, a minigun who revels in 
death and destruction; Zappy, a bio-organic lightning projector so poorly 
constructed that it could explode at any moment; the Flame Chompers, which are 
curiously sculpted in the likeness of Malphite’s head; and the Super Mega Death 
Comet, an interstellar portal lifted from one of Jinx’s old mining jobs, 
bringing mineral-rich planetoids right to an opponent’s face. Boom!

Of course, none of them can actually talk, or present personalities. They are 
inanimate.

Weapons are inanimate.
