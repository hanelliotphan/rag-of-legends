## Biography
Raised by the Templar Order, Zed dedicated himself to all its teachings at a 
young age. He learned every fundamental truth, and passed every harsh trial, 
until the day he stood proudly before his masters, and was anointed into their 
ranks. Only then was Zed given what was to be his final and greatest test: to 
seek out and protect one of the legendary megafauna—a truly ancient creature, 
worshipped as a god by many among the edgeworlds.

It was a test he would fail… in a manner of speaking.

An expedition of Demaxian troopers ambushed the young Templar, seeking to 
harvest the creature’s ora for themselves. Unwilling to let such power fall 
into the hands of non-believers, Zed killed it before their eyes, an act 
defying every tenet of the Templar faith. In an explosion of cosmic energy, 
the ora consumed him in body and mind.

Ever since, Zed has seen himself—or rather, themselves—as the most perfect 
expression of all life. With the interdimensional whispers of ora guiding him 
across deep space, he has become a monstrous entity, capable of swift and 
deadly destruction.

All other living beings are but distractions from his new vision of harmony—a 
galaxy cleansed of the weak and undeserving.

I mean, it’s a solid gig. If you can get it.

## Weapon
Ora Suit

Zed is infused with ora in its purest form. It writhes across his skin, 
transforming his limbs and crafting living weapons—from shimmering blades to 
wicked throwing stars, and countless other objects with keen, aggressive edges.

With enough willpower, he can even summon autonomous clones of himself from the 
ora. These confuse and distract his enemies, making them question their own 
senses, or forcing them to defend from multiple directions at once.

But above all, the clones offer Zed a familiar face when he finds himself 
dining alone.

What? That’s totally something Zed should consider. He seems lonely.
