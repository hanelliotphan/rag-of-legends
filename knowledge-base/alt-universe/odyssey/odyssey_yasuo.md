## Biography
Yasuo was born into a life of luxury among the superstructures and gleaming 
lights of the largest metropolis in the coreworlds. Handsome, talented, and 
wanting for literally nothing, he loaned out his services as a premier 
bodyguard of celebrities and imperial dignitaries, spending his nights in a 
drunken haze as he aimlessly wandered from high-end nightclub to high-end 
nightclub. He probably would have lived his entire life without a care in the 
world… had he not been framed for his brother’s gruesome murder.

As dozens of Demaxian enforcers and rogue agents closed in on his location, 
Yasuo picked up a couple of down-and-out lunatics at a local bar, hijacked a 
ship, and ran.

He’s been running ever since. Not bad for a man whose only real problem used to 
be putting on pants for the day.

Yasuo barely qualifies as a captain, much less a capable human being receptive 
to the needs of others. But he fights well, and unbeknownst to anyone but Sona, 
holds the key to avenging his brother, opening the legendary Ora Gate, and 
saving the universe from destruction. Maybe it’s not the destiny he deserves, 
but it’s one that, sooner or later, he’ll have to come to terms with.

## Weapon
Song, and Space Lizard

Yasuo’s blade is called Song, and not for any particular reason. Yasuo thought 
it sounded cool, so that’s what he went with. It’s not even an heirloom or 
anything. He bought it at the store.

However, the needs of rich and famous celebrities demand a certain degree of 
flashiness that a regular old laser-sword just can’t muster—and now the blade 
is so heavily augmented with ora that it barely resembles its original model. 
Capable of creating pure energy barriers and bolts of plasma, Song is a 
powerful weapon even in unskilled hands. And Yasuo is exceptionally skilled.

Perched on his shoulder, meanwhile, is Space Lizard. The crew of the Morning 
Star hasn’t given it a proper name, and probably never will, since it’s just 
some exotic species of reptile stolen from a maximum-security nature reserve, 
to be flipped for a tidy profit. But it can blow bubbles, and Yasuo secretly 
loves that.
