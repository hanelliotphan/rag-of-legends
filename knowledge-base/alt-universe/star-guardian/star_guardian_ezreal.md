## About
Before he was awakened by the First Star, Ezreal was a born explorer with 
boundless curiosity for the world around him, and becoming a Star Guardian only 
served to further fuel his appetite for discovery. Now, the universe is his 
uncharted map, the stars his destinations. As a newcomer to the team, his 
energy can be both refreshing and annoying to his teammates. The burdens of 
being a Star Guardian are lost on him—he’d rather focus his energy on solving 
the exciting mysteries of the galaxy. During the team’s travels, he has been 
known to wander off without notice, but always returning when he is most 
needed. For the time being, though, a certain pink-haired Guardian from another 
team has caught his attention...

## Magical Mediums
Yuuto - Yuuto is a mirror of Ezreal’s youthful wanderlust, though it prefers to 
witness their travels from inside the explorer’s gauntlet. But when out in the 
open, the feline freely roams the skies, serving as a valuable scout. It can 
also fuse with Ezreal to grant him angelic wings and the power of flight, which 
often leaves an impression on the ladies.
