## About
Feared and admired, Syndra is a formidable Star Guardian from an earlier era. 
Like Janna, her history is cloaked in shadow, but it’s clear as day that she is 
an ambitious warrior who is quick to dismiss those she deems unworthy of her 
time. Currently, she acts as an advisor on Ahri’s team, guiding them away from 
unforeseen dangers and toward a promising future. Despite Ahri’s trust in her, 
some members have questioned the veteran’s true motives and suspect there is no 
price that Syndra won’t pay to achieve her personal goals.

## Magical Mediums
Multi - A triple-manifestation of Syndra’s incredible power, Multi represent an 
array of emotions. These impish orbs make various squeaks, chuckles, and 
snickers while carrying out the veteran Guardian’s will. They never stray too 
far from her side; she is the center of their little universe, and the only one 
who can juggle their energy.
