No 1 Diva

Eve’s reputation paints her as a demanding diva. She told Pop Shine, “I’m an 
artist, not a socialite. I won’t apologize for high standards.” Eve once walked 
off the stage of a live performance when her vocals were backed by an audio 
track she didn’t approve. Though her presence in the industry is turbulent, she 
has a diehard fan base who call themselves “Deeva.” Prior to K/DA, Evelynn 
released two hit singles, Agony’s Embrace and Ecstasy.
