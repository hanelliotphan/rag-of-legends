# Bandle City

## Summary
Opinions differ as to where exactly the home of the yordles is to be found, 
though a handful of mortals claim to have traveled unseen pathways to a land of 
curious enchantment beyond the material realm. They tell of a place of 
unfettered magic, where the foolhardy can be led astray by myriad wonders, and 
end up lost in a dream...

In Bandle City, it is said that every sensation is heightened for non-yordles. 
Colors are brighter. Food and drink intoxicates the senses for years and, once 
tasted, will never be forgotten. The sunlight is eternally golden, the waters 
crystal clear, and every harvest brings a fruitful bounty. Perhaps some of 
these claims are true, or maybe noneâ€”for no two taletellers ever seem to agree o
n what they actually saw.

Only one thing is known for certain, and that is the timeless quality of Bandle 
City and its inhabitants. This might explain why those mortals who find their 
way back often appear to have aged tremendously, while many more never return 
at all.
