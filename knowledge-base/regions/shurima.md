# Shurima

## Summary
The empire of Shurima was once a thriving civilization that spanned an entire 
continent. Forged in a bygone age by the mighty god-warriors of the Ascended 
Host, it united all the disparate peoples of the south, and enforced a lasting 
peace between them.

Few dared to rebel. Those that did, like the accursed nation of Icathia, were 
crushed without mercy.

However, after several thousand years of growth and prosperity, the failed 
Ascension of Shurima’s last emperor left the capital in ruins, and tales of the 
empire’s former glory became little more than myth. Now, most of the nomadic 
inhabitants of Shurima’s deserts eke out a meager existence from the 
unforgiving land. Some have built small outposts to defend the few oases, while 
others delve into long lost catacombs in search of the untold riches that must 
surely lay buried there. There are also those who live as mercenaries, taking 
coin for their service before disappearing back into the lawless wastelands.

Still, a handful dare to dream of a return to the old ways. Indeed, more 
recently the tribes have been stirred by whispers from the heart of the 
desert—that their emperor Azir has returned, to lead them into a new, wondrous 
age.
