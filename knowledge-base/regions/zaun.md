# Zaun

## Summary
Zaun is a large, undercity district, lying in the deep canyons and valleys 
threading Piltover. What light reaches below is filtered through fumes leaking 
rom the tangles of corroded pipework and reflected from the stained glass of 
its industrial architecture. Zaun and Piltover were once united, but are now 
separate, yet symbiotic societies. Though it exists in perpetual smogged 
twilight, Zaun thrives, its people vibrant and its culture rich. Piltover’s 
wealth has allowed Zaun to develop in tandem; a dark mirror of the city above. 
Many of the goods coming to Piltover find their way into Zaun’s black markets, 
and hextech inventors who find the restrictions placed upon them in the city 
above too restrictive often find their dangerous researches welcomed in Zaun. 
Unfettered development of volatile technologies and reckless industry has 
rendered whole swathes of Zaun polluted and dangerous. Streams of toxic runoff 
stagnate in the city’s lower reaches, but even here people find a way to exist 
and prosper.
