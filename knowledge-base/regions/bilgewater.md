# Bilgewater

## Summary
Nestled away in the Blue Flame Isles archipelago, Bilgewater is a port city 
like no other—home to serpent hunters, dock gangs, and smugglers from across 
the known world. Here, fortunes are made and ambitions shattered in the blink 
of an eye. For those fleeing justice, debt, or persecution, Bilgewater can be a 
place of new beginnings, for no one on these twisted streets cares about your 
past. Even so, with each new dawn, careless travelers can always be found 
floating in the harbor, their purses empty and their throats slit…

While incredibly dangerous, Bilgewater is ripe with opportunity, free from the 
shackles of formal government and trade regulation. If you have the coin, 
almost anything can be purchased here, from outlawed hextech to the favor of 
local crime lords.

With the recent removal of the last “reaver king” of Bilgewater, the city has 
entered a period of transition, while the most prominent captains try to agree 
on its future. But as long as there are seaworthy ships and crews to sail them, 
Bilgewater is likely to remain one of the most colorful and well-connected 
places in Runeterra.
