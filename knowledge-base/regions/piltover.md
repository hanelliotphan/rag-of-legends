# Piltover

## Summary
Piltover is a thriving, progressive city whose power and influence is on the 
rise. It is Valoran’s cultural center, where art, craftsmanship, trade and 
innovation walk hand in hand. Its power comes not through military might, but 
the engines of commerce and forward thinking. Situated on the cliffs above the 
district of Zaun and overlooking the ocean, fleets of ships pass through its 
titanic sea-gates, bringing goods from all over the world. The wealth this 
generates has given rise to an unprecedented boom in the city’s growth. 
Piltover has - and still is - reinventing itself as a city where fortunes can 
be made and dreams can be lived. Burgeoning merchant clans fund development in 
the most incredible endeavors: grand artistic follies, esoteric hextech 
research, and architectural monuments to their power. With ever more inventors 
delving into the emergent lore of hextech, Piltover has become a lodestone for 
the most skilled craftsmen the world over.
