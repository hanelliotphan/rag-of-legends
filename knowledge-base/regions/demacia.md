# Demacia

## Summary
A strong, lawful kingdom with a prestigious military history, Demacia’s people 
have always valued the ideals of justice, honor, and duty most highly, and are 
fiercely proud of their cultural heritage. But in spite of these lofty 
principles, this largely self-sufficient nation has grown more insular and 
isolationist in recent centuries.

Now, Demacia is a kingdom in turmoil.

The capital, the Great City of Demacia, was founded as a refuge from sorcery 
after the nightmare of the Rune Wars, and built upon the riddle of petricite—a 
peculiar white stone that dampens magical energy. It is from here that the 
royal family has long seen to the defense of the outlying towns and villages, 
farmland, forests, and mountains rich with mineral resources.

However, following the sudden death of King Jarvan III, the other noble 
families have not yet approved the succession of his sole heir, young Prince 
Jarvan, to the throne.

Those who dwell beyond the heavily guarded borders are increasingly viewed with 
suspicion, and many former allies have begun to look elsewhere for protection, 
in these uncertain times. Some dare to whisper that the golden age of Demacia 
has passed, and unless its people are willing to adapt to a changing 
world—something many believe they are simply incapable of doing—the kingdom’s 
decline may be inevitable.

And all the petricite in the land will not protect Demacia from itself.
