# The Void

## Summary
Screaming into existence with the birth of the universe, the Void is a 
manifestation of the unknowable nothingness that lies beyond. It is a force of 
insatiable hunger, waiting through the eons until its masters, the mysterious 
Watchers, mark the final time of undoing.

To be a mortal touched by this power is to suffer an agonizing glimpse of 
eternal unreality, enough to shatter even the strongest mind. Denizens of the 
Void realm itself are construct-creatures, often of only limited sentience, but 
tasked with a singular purposeâ€”to usher in total oblivion across Runeterra.
