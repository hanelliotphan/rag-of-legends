# Targon

## Summary
Mount Targon is the mightiest peak in Runeterra, a towering peak of sun-baked 
rock amid a range of summits unmatched in scale anywhere else in the world. 
Located far from civilization, Mount Targon is utterly remote and all but 
impossible to reach save by the most determined seeker. Many legends cling to 
Mount Targon, and, like any place of myth, it is a beacon to dreamers, madmen 
and questors of adventure. Some of these brave souls attempt to scale the 
impossible mountain, perhaps seeking wisdom or enlightenment, perhaps chasing 
glory or some soul-deep yearning to witness its summit. The ascent is all but 
impossible, and those hardy few who somehow survive to reach the top almost 
never speak of what they have seen. Some return with a haunted, empty look in 
their eyes, others changed beyond all recognition, imbued by an Aspect of 
unearthly, inhuman power with a destiny few mortals can comprehend.
