# Ixtal

## Summary
Renowned for its mastery of elemental magic, Ixtal was one of the first 
independent nations to join the Shuriman empire. In truth, Ixtali culture is 
much older—part of the great westward diaspora that gave rise to civilizations 
including the Buhru, magnificent Helia, and the ascetics of Targon—and it is 
likely they played a significant role in the creation of the first Ascended.

But the mages of Ixtal survived the Void, and later the Darkin, by distancing 
themselves from their neighbors, drawing the wilderness around them like a 
shield. While much had already been lost, they were committed to the 
preservation of what little remained…

Now, secluded deep in the jungle for thousands of years, the sophisticated 
arcology-city of Ixaocan remains mostly free of outside influence. Having 
witnessed from afar the ruination of the Blessed Isles and the Rune Wars that 
followed, the Ixtali view all the other factions of Runeterra as upstarts and 
pretenders, and use their powerful magic to keep any intruders at bay.
