# Shadow Isles

## Summary
This cursed land was once home to a noble, enlightened civilization, known to 
its allies and emissaries as the Blessed Isles. However, more than a thousand 
years ago, an unprecedented magical cataclysm left the barrier between the 
material and spirit realms in tatters, effectively merging the two… and dooming 
all living things in an instant.

Now, a malevolent Black Mist permanently shrouds the Isles, and the earth 
itself is tainted by dark sorcery. Mortals who dare to venture to these dismal 
shores will slowly have their life force stolen away from them, which in turn 
attracts the insatiable, restless spirits of the dead.

Those who perish within the Mist are condemned to haunt this nightmarish place 
for eternity—worse still, the power of the Shadow Isles appears to wax stronger 
with every passing year, allowing the most powerful specters to roam farther 
and farther across Runeterra.
